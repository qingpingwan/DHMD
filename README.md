# 🎉Welcome to the Official Repo for DHMD! 
Thanks for stopping by!

This is where you'll find the code implementation for our paper"**DHMD: Dynamic LVLMs Integration for Efficient Harmful Meme Detection**".

We’re keeping it brief for now, but once the paper is published, we'll be rolling out a detailed guide with more goodies! Stay tuned. 📚

## 🔭Brief Introduction
